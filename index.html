                <p class="card-text">Rajapaksa resigned in July after tens of thousands of protesters angered by a debilitating economic crisis stormed his office and residence.He fled to the Maldives on July 9, went to Singapore from there and spent the past few weeks in Thailand on a diplomatic visa.Al Jazeera’s Minelle Fernandez, reporting from Colombo, confirmed Rajapaksa’s return “We do have confirmation that former President Gotabaya Rajapaksa has returned to the country,” she saidFernandez later said that the return had “happened very quickly”.“No one expected him to return when he literally fled the country on a military jet just a few weago,Fernandezsaid.“What his options are in the coming days and months will remain to be seen. He’s obviously relinquished office, but  he’s very much part of the Rajapaksa clan and the family and they haven’t given up, as far as we’re hearing, in terms of politics.</p>

                <p class="card-text">Russian energy giant Gazprom has postponed a Saturday deadline to
                restore flows via a crucial gas supply route to Europe, citing an oil leakage
                in the Nord Stream 1 pipeline discovered during maintenance.The energy company had
                shut down the pipeline on Wednesday for what it said would be three days of
                maintenance, but said in a social media post on Friday evening that.“Such leaks do not normally affect the operation of a turbine and can be sealed on site,” the company said in a statement. “In the past, too, the occurrence of this <br><br> type of leak has not led to a shutdown of operations.”
                Adding that it was currently not contracted to work on that specific maintenance issue,Siemens said it had “pointedout severaltimes that there are sufficient otherturbines  available at the Portovayacompressor station for NordStream 1 to operate”.</p>

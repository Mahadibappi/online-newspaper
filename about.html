    <h5>Q.01 what is difference between ver let and const</h5>
    <p>
      Answer: let: The let keyword declares a block-scoped local variable,
      optionally initializing it to a value. Block-scoped means that the
      variable is only available within the block it was declared in, which is
      usually denoted by curly braces {}. <br />
      var: The var keyword declares a function-scoped or global variable,
      optionally initializing it to a value. Function-scoped means that the
      variable is only available within the function it was declared in. Global
      variables are available throughout your entire code. <br />
      const: The const keyword declares a block-scoped, immutable constant
      variable, i.e. a variable that can’t be reassigned. Constants are also
      called “immutable variables”, but that’s a bit of a misnomer since they
      are actually variables – just ones that can’t be reassigned.

    <h5>Q.02 what is difference between arrow and regular function</h5>
    <p>
      Answer: Inside of a regular JavaScript function, this value (aka the
      execution context) is dynamic.The dynamic context means that the value of
      this depends on how the function is invoked. In JavaScript, there are 4
      ways you can invoke a regular function.The behavior of this inside of an
      arrow function differs considerably from the regular function's this
      behavior. The arrow function doesn't define its own execution context.As
      seen in the previous section, the regular function can easily construct
      objects.A consequence of this resolved lexically is that an arrow function
      cannot be used as a constructor.Inside the body of a regular function,
      arguments is a special array-like object containing the list of arguments
      with which the function has been invoked.On the other side, no arguments
      special keyword is defined inside an arrow function.

    <h5>Q.03 what is difference between map and filter and filter</h5>
    <p>
      Answer:They both return a new array. map returns a new array of elements
      where you have applied some function on the element so that it changes the
      original element (typically). filter returns a new array of the elements
      of the original array (with no change to the original values). filter will
      only return elements where the function you specify returns a value of
      true for each element passed to the function.So map returns the same
      number of elements as the original, but the element value will be
      transformed in some way and filter will return the same or less number of
      elements than the original but not change the original elements’
      values.filter() returns an array containing the element that satisfies the
      condition, but find() returns the element itself that satisfies the
      condition
